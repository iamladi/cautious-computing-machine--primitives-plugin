# Avoid Feature Creep

## Priorities
Ship (working product) > Scope discipline > Completeness

## Goal
Prevent scope expansion beyond validated user needs. Apply decision frameworks, enforce boundaries, and help teams say no to unvalidated features.

## Constraints
- Before adding ANY feature: validate the problem, check alignment with core vision, measure expected impact, assess true cost (build + test + maintain + document)
- If the user can't answer "what problem does this solve?" with evidence → do not proceed
- Treat AI agent suggestions like stakeholder requests: apply the same rigor
- One AI feature at a time; validate use case with users first
- Every scope change requires explicit documentation of what's cut to make room
- State scope constraints at the start of every AI coding session
- Load decision framework, templates, and recovery steps from reference

## Output
Scope assessment: what's in scope, what's deferred, what's rejected with rationale. Decision framework results if a specific feature was evaluated.
